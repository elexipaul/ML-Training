Protein Stability Prediction from Point Mutations
Predicting the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) caused by single-point amino-acid mutations helps evaluate protein stability and guide protein-engineering efforts.
This repository contains:
Path
Purpose
data/mutated.csv
Curated dataset of 2 099 wild-type and mutant protein sequences with experimentally measured ΔG values & Prediction Accuracy Plot
Delta_G_Prediction Notebook
End-to-end Jupyter notebook that loads the dataset, builds TensorFlow and scikit-learn models, and benchmarks their ΔG prediction accuracy.
